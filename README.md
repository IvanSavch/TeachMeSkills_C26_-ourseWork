This repository was created to create a program for processing payment documents.

The program only processes the TXT file. The program collects data from files and generates statistics.
Login to the program is carried out using your login and password, after which the path to the files is entered.

Only 3 types of files are processed: order, bill, invoice. Each document has its own structure and name template. The program processes only data for 2023.
All invalid files are moved to a separate file.

The program keeps a work log, which consists of the general progress of work and errors.

The final statistics consists of the total turnover for all documents and for each type.
